                <p>Welcome to my portfolio. On this site I have collected various school projects and assignments that I think are noteworthy. 
                    You can find the projects under their respective categories and there is a description of each project.
                From the Github -link you can visit my github repository, where you can view the code for these projects.</p>
                <p>I'm currently on my fourth year of studying a bachelor's degree of business information technology in JAMK University for Applied Sciences. 
                    Most of my programming experience comes from projects related to game development, 
                    but I've also been learning web app development lately.</p>
                <p>The programming languages I have studied include C#, javascript, typescript and C++. 
                    I also have some experience using frameworks/libraries including Angular, Node.js and Express.
                    On game development side of things I have mostly used Unity.</p>
