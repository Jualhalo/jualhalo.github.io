                <a href="https://github.com/Jualhalo/VirtualShock"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="projectLink">Virtual Shock</a>
                <p>Virtual Shock is a virtual reality survival horror game created by an 8 person team using Unity. 
                    I worked as the product owner and one of our two gameplay programmers for this project. I created the game's AI as well as the melee combat and noise & sound mechanics and triggered events. 
                    The game's movement, shooting and door mechanics were a pair coding effort with me and the other programmer in our team. 
                    In the repository I have included only the code that I've worked on, either fully or partially.</p>
                    <p>This project deepened my understanding of Unity game development and working on a project as part of a team. I also learned about the role of a product owner and about
                        agile development and scrum.
                    </p>
                    <p>A detailed document of the things I've learned and done for the project can be read <a href ="pdf/TC7_Portfolio_HalonenJuho.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (in finnish).</p>
                    <p>The game has been released on itch.io and can be downloaded <a href="https://teamtbd.itch.io/vrshock"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. 
                        Note that the game requires a VR headset to play.</p>

                <p>Quack is a retro style 3D first person shooter created using Unity and utilizing free ready made assets. 
                    This was my first Unity project and my first 3D game project and was created for the final assignment of a Unity game programming course. 
                    This project taught me most of the basics of game development in Unity.
                    I also learned a bit about creating basic game ai during this project.</p>
                    <p>The game can be downloaded

                <p>This is a simple dungeon crawler console application created using c++. I made this game for the final assigment of a c++ course.</p> 
                <p>This project taught me much about object oriented programming in particular, including interaction between classes, inheritance and polymorphism. 
                    I also learned about memory management in c++ and using pointers.</p>

                <h3>Project Dakka</h3>
                <p>Project Dakka is a 2D bullet hell shoot em up game. This was my first ever game project and was created using Construct3 editor utilizing free ready made assets. 
                    While the creation of the game didn't involve writing any code, this project taught me much of the logic behind games
                    and was very helpful for the projects that came after.</p>
                <p>The game has been released on itch.io and can be played <a href="https://dakkaj.itch.io/project-dakka"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
